## Overview
MCM Extender is an essential add-on for [The Mod Configuration Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507).

Allows mod authors to create feature rich, script-free MCM menus with ease.

Also includes new MCM quality-of-life features for all players.

### QoL Features
- Color Picker: Default MCM color selection sliders is replaced with an easy-to-use HSV color picker.
- Improved Visibility: Adds backgrounds to all MCM color swatches, making them easier to see.

## Mod Authors
MCM Extender introduces a powerful framework that allows you to create complex, feature-rich MCMs entirely from JSON files, with no scripting required.

### Features
- Script-Free Menus: Generate full-featured MCMs that function identically to scripted ones, directly from JSON files.
- Automatic Management: Natively handles saving settings to INIs, updating game variables, running script functions.
- No Plugin Required: Your mod no longer needs to be an ESM/ESP to have its own dedicated MCM.
